## Data

Most of the data used was extracted from the <a href="https://jforbes14.github.io/eechidna/index.html" target="_blank">`eechidna`</a> R package, which has gone to the trouble of compiling a mixture of election and census data which was easy to use.

The <a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/electorates/maps.htm" target="_blank">geospatial data</a> and <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/" target="_blank">election data</a> used was extracted from the AEC.
